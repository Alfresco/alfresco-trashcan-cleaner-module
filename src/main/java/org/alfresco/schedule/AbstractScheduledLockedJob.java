/**
 * 
 * This class should be extended any time a scheduled job needs to be
 * implemented to be executed using
 * {@link org.alfresco.repo.lock.JobLockService JobLockService}. It makes the
 * cluster aware locking of the job transparent to the implementation. On the
 * job's spring {@link org.quartz.JobExecutionContext JobExecutionContext} it
 * will still always have to be passed as parameter the
 * {@link org.alfresco.repo.lock.JobLockService jobLockService}. The name to be
 * used for locking of the job is optional, if none is passed a name will be
 * composed using the simple name of the implementation class. In general if it
 * may make sense to have more than one job setup using the same class you
 * should always use a different name on each
 * {@link org.quartz.JobExecutionContext JobExecutionContext} to differentiate
 * the jobs, unless you want the lock to be shared between the different
 * instances.
 * 
 * The only method to be implemented when extending this class is the executeJob
 * method.
